        COMPUTER TRACKING AND &apos;COOKIES&apos;<br /><br />

        Our cookies fall into 2 categories:<br /><br />

        1) ESSENTIAL COOKIES<br /><br />

        1.1) Function: Some cookies are essential for the operation of our
        website. For example, they allow us to identify subscribers and ensure
        they can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to
        disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all the content
        that a subscription entitles them too.<br /><br />

        1.2) Performance: We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors
        use our websites and to monitor website performance. This allows us
        to provide a high-quality experience by customising our offering and
        quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we
        might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most
        popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and
        to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might
        also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think
        will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website.<br /><br />

        2) THIRD-PARTY COOKIES<br /><br />


        Where third-party cookies are present on our sites, we attempt to be as
        upfront and clear as possible about their intended purpose. We also
        use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the two
        categories below.<br /><br />

        2.1) Website Function Cookies We use functionality cookies to allow us
        to remember your preferences. For example, cookies save you the
        trouble of typing in a username every time you access the site. We also
        use functionality cookies to provide you with enhanced services such as
        allowing you to watch a video online or comment on a blog.<br /><br />

        2.2) Other third-party cookies We may also use third party cookies (such
        as Google Analytics) to help us with market research, revenue tracking,
        improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms
        and conditions. We may use third-party companies to provide
        advertising services and/or to collect certain information when you visit
        and interact with our website. These third-party companies may collect
        and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream
        information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements
        clicked or scrolled over) during your visit to this website [and/or other
        websites] to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to
        be of greater interest to you. These third-party companies may use
        cookies and other technologies to recognise your browser to collect
        and record information about your web surfing activity including your
        activities on this website.<br /><br />

        You may visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance at
        http://youronlinechoices.eu/ to learn more about interest-based
        advertising, or to opt out of receiving advertisements tailored to your
        interests on your browser, from their respective members and
        participants.<br />
        As we&apos;ve explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of our
        websites. Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies,
        you may find that certain sections of our website do not work properly.<br /><br />

        CHANGES<br /><br />

        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time on order to reflect,
        for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or
        regulatory reasons.<br /><br />
