        <h3>Do you provide free samples?</h3>

        Sorry no, as a small business I cannot generally afford to provide free samples, unless I am running a particular one-off offer. However, there are mini sized version of each product (apart from the Revive Body Scrub) to purchase, to try, before you commit to the more expensive larger standard size.<br /><br />

        <h3>Are products suitable for vegans?</h3>

        The majority of our products are vegan friendly, however there are a few products in which we use beeswax. The following products are not suitable for vegans;.<br /><br />

        All 3 Shine Lip Balms<br />
        Nourishing Beauty Balm<br /><br />

        Hyaluronic acid can be sourced from animals, yet we have a vegan source derived from the bacterial fermentation of yeast and glucose derived from beans and potatoes.<br /><br />

        <h3>Are products cruelty free?</h3>

        Just by Emma believes that beauty products should all be cruelty free. We are currently in the process of applying to be Leaping Bunny approved. A global programme, Leaping Bunny requires cruelty free standards over and above legal requirements.<br /><br />

        <h3>What is the shelf life of products?</h3>

        Just by Emma products are made fresh in small micro batches. All products will clearly indicate how long they last on the label, this will be between 6-12 months. All products should be stored away in a cool dry place and from direct sunlight as this can affect the quality of the product. Most of the products are packaged in amber glass which helps alleviate some of the damage sunlight can do.<br /><br />

        <h3>What do you mean by natural ingredients?</h3>

        Each product&apos;s formulation contain natural and naturally derived ingredients. I never formulate with synthetic colours, fragrances, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, EDTA, Sulphates (SLS, SLES and ALS), Silicones and Mineral oil.
        I do formulate with the highest quality natural, plant oils and butters. I like to work with natural active ingredients that are scientifically proven to deliver visible results. I use natural emulsifiers and preservatives that enable me to formulate products that are safe and gentle for customers. I pride myself on being completely transparent about what ingredients are contained in each product. Find out more on the ingredients page<br /><br />

        Just by Emma source ingredients from reputable suppliers who also have clear ethical policies. If you require more information on the suppliers I use, please email me at <a href='mailto:Emma<info@justbyemma.com>'>info@justbyemma.com</a><br /><br />

        <h3>Do products contain preservatives?</h3>

        All cosmetics containing water (in my range; Regenerating Face Cream and Orange & Coconut Body Cream) should contain a preservative to protect the quality of the product and the customer. The only oil-based product which contains a preservative is the Revive Body Scrub, due to the nature of how this product is used, I felt it necessary to add a preservative to protect the quality and extend its shelf life, as this product is used in the shower or the bath which could in turn contaminate the product very easily. Using the preservative protects the quality of the product. These products contain Preservative Eco which is Palm free and contains ingredients which are naturally derived and are approved by COSMOS.<br /><br />

        <h3>Can you explain how creams and lotions are made, are they natural?</h3>

        To make a cream or a lotion you require an emulsifier. An emulsifier is a substance which enables oil and water to be combined and stabilised to form an emulsion. An example of an emulsion in skincare terms would be a face cream or body lotion which is created by combining oil and water, two substances which don&apos;t mix, into a fine-textured and stable product. I used two types of Emulsifiers, one, Vegetal which is derived from plant sugars (Coconut & Corn) using eco-friendly principles, this is in the Regenerating Face Cream and Orange & Coconut Body Cream. The second emulsifier used is in the Revive Body Scrub, this is so the oil in the scrub turns to milk on contact with water, to avoid a slippery mess in the shower. I use AroEmul AOF Bio which is of a 100% vegetable origin, combining organic glycerin sourced from the nut oil of the Karanja tree, organic sweet almond oil, water from organic oranges and sugar esters. All plant sources in both are non GMO and are PEG free, plus both are totally biodegradable.<br /><br />

        <h3>How are the products fragranced?</h3>

        Essential Oils are &quot;essential&quot; in each of the products within the range. The essential oil blend is chosen for its therapeutic and healing benefits for the skin, plus to enhance the sensory experience of the product. Each products formulation contains essential oils that are well within the maximum dermal limits, making them gentle on your skin and less likely to irritate. However, I am very clear of each essential oils&quot; potential allergen - please see each individual products&quot; ingredient list if you have any concerns or allergies.<br /><br />

        <h3>Are products allergen-free?</h3>

        Sorry no. It is impossible to guarantee that a product is allergen-free as any ingredient can be an allergen to someone, somewhere. Please be aware the Regenerating Face Cream does contain Macadamia nut oil so please avoid this product if you have a particular allergy associated with this nut. For any other allergies you are unsure off, please always check each products full ingredients list.<br /><br />

        I provide all ingredient information in English, as well as giving the INCI name, to assist you in deciding if a product is suitable for you. However, it is vital for you to carefully read the full ingredients list and use instructions as well as patch test any new product.<br /><br />

        I hand make all products in my home studio skincare lab, where I follow good manufacturing procedures that ensure the working environment is free from major allergens. Each product is made in individual batches away from another product and sanitised before making another product. Suppliers are selected under strict criteria to meet certain standards; however, the nature of the supply chain means not all suppliers can guarantee that ingredients are free from contamination.<br /><br />

        <h3>Are products suitable for my skin type?</h3>

        All the products are formulated to be suitable for all skin types, though they are particularly great for skin which is combination and hormonal. I began this journey initially to heal my skin and this is my skin type. However, using a combination of all the products in the simple skincare routine, they can suit all skin types.<br /><br />

        <h3>Are products palm oil free?</h3>

        Yes. Rest assured that my products contain no palm oil or any ingredients derived from palm. Ingredients such as glycerine and glyceryl stearate are often made with palm oil. However, I have sourced palm free glycerine and a palm-free emulsifier.<br /><br />

        <h3>How are the products made?</h3>

        All products are formulated and handmade in my home studio lab in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Emma White, the founder holds a Diploma in Skincare Formulation (School of Natural Skincare), Certificate in Organic Anti-Ageing Skincare (Formula Botanica). All formulations and products have undergone safety, stability and microbial testing required by UK/EU law.<br /><br />


        <h3>Packaging?</h3>

        Just by Emma products are packaged in glass or aluminium which are fully recyclable. Most standard sized products are packaged using amber glass to help protect the oils and botanical ingredients in each of the formulations. Amber glass absorbs the most comprehensive range of light waves of the light spectrum. Amber glass is the best choice for protection from UV light. The colour serves purpose beyond being aesthetically pleasing, helping to keep the product safe and unchanged. However, please ensure products are stored in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight to further maintain product quality.<br /><br />

        <h3>Can I return empty containers to you?</h3>

        I am currently working on a plan to enable customers to send back empty containers to me, with a view to passing on a small discount on your next purchase. I&apos;m passionate about making this work. Watch out for any updates on this.<br /><br />

        <h3>How do I dispose of empty packaging?</h3>

        All the glass and aluminium jars and bottles can be recycled alongside other glass and aluminium products. Lids and glass pipettes can also be recycled. I recommend removing the glass dropper part of the pipette to enable you to sort your recycling waste effectively. Currently the only part of the packaging which can&apos;t be recycled is the pump on the Regenerating Face Cream, I am committed to making improvements in the packaging of this product and I will update this very soon.
